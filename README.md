### A Library Management Web App ðŸ“š

A practice project using React, TypeScript, Vite.

The user interface (UI) layout was based on a Figma template titled [**"Library Management App â€“ UI"**](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1121145214000676475) by *CsÅ‘sz Roland*, which is adapted for this project.

Currently, the web application only allows users to add and delete books.
