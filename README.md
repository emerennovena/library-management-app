## A Library Management Web App ðŸ“š

A practice project using React, TypeScript, Vite

The user interface (UI) layout was initially based on a publicly available Figma Community template titled <b>"Library Management App â€“ UI"</b> by <i>CsÅ‘sz Roland</i>, which I adapted for this project: https://www.figma.com/community/file/1121145214000676475
