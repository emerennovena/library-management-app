# A Library Management Web App ðŸ“š

A practice project using React, TypeScript, Vite

The user interface (UI) layout was initially based on a publicly available Figma Community template titled Library Management App â€“ UI by CsÅ‘sz Roland, which I adapted for this project. https://www.figma.com/community/file/1121145214000676475
